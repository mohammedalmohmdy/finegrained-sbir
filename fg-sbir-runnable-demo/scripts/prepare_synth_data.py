"""This script is intentionally light: the synthetic dataset is generated on the fly
via torchvision CIFAR10 with an edge filter for sketches, so no action is required.
Kept for parity with real datasets if you later add download/prepare steps."""
print("No preparation needed for the synthetic demo. Training will auto-download CIFAR10.")
